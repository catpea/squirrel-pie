The Squirrel Protection License (SPL) https://github.com/catpea/SPL
Version 1.0, 2025

Copyright (c) 2025 catpea and the International Squirrel Defense League

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person or sentient being
obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files
(the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including
without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute,
sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom
the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

1. SQUIRREL WELFARE CLAUSE
   No squirrel shall be harmed, distressed, or otherwise bothered in the
   development, deployment, or usage of this Software. This includes but is
   not limited to: chasing, startling, photography without consent (tail
   flicks indicate non-consent), or making sudden movements near squirrels
   engaged in important acorn-related business.

2. HABITAT PRESERVATION
   Users of this Software hereby pledge to plant at least one (1) nut-bearing
   tree per major release deployed, or to leave out unsalted peanuts on a
   regular basis. Bird feeders that actively exclude squirrels are considered
   violations of this license and will result in bad karma.

3. NAMING RIGHTS
   The name "Squirrel Pie" shall never, under any circumstances, be used to
   refer to actual squirrel-based culinary preparations. Any such usage will
   result in immediate license termination and a lifetime of acorns thrown at
   your head by organized squirrel activists.

4. ADMIRATION REQUIREMENT
   Users must, at least once per week, pause their work to watch a squirrel
   and say (aloud or internally), "Wow, that's a good squirrel." Failure to
   comply may result in decreased code quality and general misfortune.

5. EMERGENCY RESPONSE
   Should a squirrel be found in distress near any location where this
   Software is in use, the user must immediately cease work and contact
   appropriate wildlife rescue services. Debugging can wait. The squirrel
   cannot.

6. TAIL RESPECT
   All references to squirrels in comments, documentation, or commit messages
   must acknowledge the magnificence of their tails. Phrases like "rat with a
   fancy tail" are expressly prohibited and considered hate speech.

7. WINTER PREPARATION
   Between September and November (Northern Hemisphere) or March and May
   (Southern Hemisphere), users must show extra patience and understanding
   toward squirrels engaged in frantic caching behavior. They're just trying
   to survive winter, unlike you with your heated office and DoorDash.

8. NO SQUIRREL PIE BAKING
   Users expressly agree to never, ever bake, cook, prepare, contemplate,
   or Google recipes for actual squirrel pie. This is non-negotiable.
   Violations will be enforced by a council of very disappointed squirrels.

9. PARK ETIQUETTE
   When using this Software in parks or outdoor spaces where squirrels are
   present, users must maintain a respectful distance and resist the urge to
   share their snacks (unless said snacks are unsalted nuts, in which case,
   sharing is encouraged but not required).

10. SPIRITUAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT
    Users acknowledge that squirrels are better at:
    - Planning ahead (see: winter preparation)
    - Risk assessment (see: power line navigation)
    - Work-life balance (see: nap frequency)
    - Physical fitness (see: vertical tree sprinting)
    - And probably coding, but they choose not to show off

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF SQUIRREL DIGNITY.

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS, COPYRIGHT HOLDERS, OR SQUIRREL REPRESENTATIVES
BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE
SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE, EXCEPT IN CASES WHERE
SAID DEALINGS RESULT IN HARM TO SQUIRRELS, IN WHICH CASE ALL BETS ARE OFF.

By using this Software, you agree to uphold these principles and to be a
friend to squirrels everywhere. They didn't ask to share this planet with
us, but here we are, and the least we can do is be cool about it.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this license is executed by unanimous chittering approval
of the Squirrel Council, convened under the Great Oak on this day.

Witnessed by:
- Sir Nutsworth III, Esq. (tail signature: three flicks and a twirl)
- Professor Acornella McGee, PhD in Tree Navigation
- The Honorable Bushytail McFlufferson, Supreme Arbiter of Park Justice

NOTE: This Squirrel Protection License is a humorous addendum and does not
supersede the legal MIT License under which this software is actually
distributed. However, the spirit of squirrel protection is very much legally
binding in the court of common decency.
